                    <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year
                        1972. It
                        was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main
                        features of
                        C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these
                        features
                        make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler
                        development.
                        Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like
                        syntax
                        of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly
                        a
                        superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).</p>

                    <p>In a C source program, the basic element recognized by the compiler is the "token." A token is

                        and commas (,) are also tokens.

                    <p>
                        A "comment" is a sequence of characters beginning with a forward slash/asterisk combination (/*)
                        that is
                        treated as a single white-space character by the compiler and is otherwise ignored. A comment
                        can
                        include any combination of characters from the representable character set, including newline
                        characters, but excluding the "end comment" delimiter (*/). Comments can occupy more than one
                        line
                        but
                        cannot be nested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Comments can appear anywhere a white-space character is allowed. Since the compiler treats a
                        comment
                        as
                        a single white-space character, you cannot include comments within tokens. The compiler ignores
                        the
                        characters in the comment.
                    </p>
                    <p>Use comments to document your code. This example is a comment accepted by the compiler:</p>
                    <code>
                <pre style="color:green">
                        /* Comments can contain keywords such as
                        for and while without generating errors. */
                </pre>
            </code>
                    <p>Comments can appear on the same line as a code statement:</p>
                    <code>
                <pre>
                    <span style="color: blue">printf</span>(<span style="color:red"> "Hello\n" </span>);  <span style="color:green"> /* Comments can go here */</span>

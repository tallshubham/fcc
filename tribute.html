            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July
                2015) was an aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was
                born
                and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
                four
                decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
                Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
                civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the
                Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

            <p>
                Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian
                honour.</p>
            <p>
                While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an
                apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands including national-level dignitaries
                attended
                the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried with full state honours.
